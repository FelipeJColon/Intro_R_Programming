       - Data frames


# 0. Introduction

## What is R?
- R is a suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and 
graphical display
- A vehicle for developing methods for interactive data analysis
- Fast developing with thousand of contributors around the world
- An environment where classical and modern statistical techniques can be 
implemented

## Why R?
1. With R you can do  [almost anything you need](http://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/shiny-user-showcase//) 
for data analysis

2. R runs on **almost any** standard computing platform and operating system

3. It is **_free and open source!_** so it creates a platform to allow users 
develop new things
       - There are over 4000 packages developed by users from around the world.

4. There are frequent and regular releases so bugs are constantly addressed

5. It has sophisticated graphic capabilities that allow generating **_publication
quality_** graphics


## An Example

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
require(plotly)
p <- plot_ly(iris, x = ~Sepal.Width, y = ~Sepal.Length) 
add_markers(p, color = ~Species, size = ~Petal.Length)
```

## Some limitations

1. It is **_memory expensive_** (i.e. objects are stored in physical [RAM] 
memory)
       - although progress has been made to address the issue

2. Most packages are **_developed based on demand_** and user contributions
       - If the method you are interested in is not available, you will need to
       either implement it, ask someone to do so, or look for an alternative
       software

4. Some packages **_duplicate functions_** previously developed in well 
documented packages
3. Several packages contributed by users are **_poorly documented_** (although
this has improved substantially)

# 1. Entering and Evaluating Input


## Open R Studio
- I would **_strongly_** encourage you to keep `R Studio` open over the whole
session
- **_Feel free to play_** with the code during the session, you can always 
catch up with the slides at a later point!

## Typing data into the console
- The R Console is the place where all operations are evaluated
- The simplest way is to type in the operation you want to evaluate

```r
> 2 + 2 
[1] 4
```
<br>
- The number in brackets `[1]` indicates the result of the evaluated function
and tells you that `4` is the first element (and in this case the only element)
of the output
- The output is **not stored** into the memory because the operation was not 
**assinged** to any `object`

## The Assignment Operator
- By convention, the assignment operator in R `"<-"` 
- You may alternatively use `=` but I would not recommend it

```r
> a <- 2 + 2     # Accepted by convention

> a = 2 + 2      # Operationally the same but not recommended
```
<br>
- Notice that the output is not printed unless you type the name
of the object where the output is stored

## Evaluation
- When expressions are evaluated, their result is returned
- Such result `may or may not` be automatically printed to the console depending 
on how the expression is entered

```r
> x <- 1:10     # Nothing printed

> x             # Auto-printing
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10

> (x <- 1:10)   # Auto-printing
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10

> print(x)      # Explicit printing
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
```

## R Syntax
- R is **_case sensitive_** (so `A` and `a` **_are different objects_**)

```r
> a <- 2 + 2 
> A
Error: object 'A' not found
```

<br>
- Normally **_all alphanumeric symbols are allowed_** plus `.` and `_`

```r
> mydata  <- 2 * 3

> my.data <- 2 + 2 

> my_data <- 3 * 2

```

## R Syntax
- Object names **_must start_** with `"."` or a letter
- If they start with `.` the second character **_cannot be a digit_**

```r
> 12obs <- 1:12
Error: unexpected symbol in "12obs"

> .12obs
Error: unexpected symbol in ".12obs"

> .obs12 <- 1:12
```
<br>
- Object names are unlimited in length 

```r
Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch <- 1
```

## Commands
- Consecutive commands should be separated either by a semi-colon `;`, or by 
a new line

```r
> a <- 1 + 3 ; b <- 2 + 2
```
<br>
- If a command is not complete at the end of a line, R will give a different 
prompt (`+`) on the subsequent line(s) and will continue to read input 
**_until the command is syntactically complete_**

```r
> a <- 1 +
+ 
+ 
+ 2
> a
[1] 3
```

## R Syntax
- Blank spaces are typically not an issue but abusing them 
decreases the readability of your code
- You may be interested in reading the 
[Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html) style guide for examples of 
good coding practice

```r
> x <- 1:10              # OK

> x<-1:10                # Too little space 

> x <- 1    :    10      # Way too much!

> x <- c (TRUE,FALSE)    # OK

> x <- c (TRUE, FALSE)   # OK

> x    <-    c ( TRUE   ,  FALSE  )    # Too much!
```

## Comments
- Comments are useful to remember what you are doing and why
- The `#` character indicates a comment
- Anything to the right of `#` (and the `#` itself) **is ignored**
- The `#` **_is the only comment character recognized by_** `R`
- Unless you have an exceptional memory, I would advise you **document every
step of your analysis** (it'll save you lots of headaches!)

## Comments

```r
## ------------------------------------------
## Evaluate the effect of supplement type
## on tooth growth
## ------------------------------------------
# Load data
> require(datasets)
> data(ToothGrowth)

# Compute summary statistics table
> myStats <- summary(ToothGrowth)

# Show data structure
> str(ToothGrowth)

# Generate exploratory plot by supplement type
> boxplot(len ~ supp, col=c("tomato", "steelblue"), data=ToothGrowth)
```

## Listing and Removing Objects
- During a session all objects are created and stored by name
- The `ls()` command allows you to display the names of
most (or all depending on how many there are) objects stored in memory
- The collection of objects stored is called the **workspace**
- You can remove objects from the workspace with `rm()`

```r
> ls()
[1] "dfr" "i"   "m"   "msg" "x"  

> rm(x)

> ls()
[1] "dfr" "i"   "m"   "msg"
```

## Basic Operations
- You can perform all basic arithmetic and statistical operations in R
without having to call functions other than those pre-installed

```r
> 2 + 2

> 3 * 2 

> 6 / 2

> 6 ^ 2

> sqrt(9 * pi)
```

## Basic Operations
- You can perform all basic arithmetic and statistical operations in R
without having to call functions other than those pre-installed

```r
> x <- rnorm(10)
> mean(x)
> median(x)
> var(x)
> sd(x)
> range(x)
> min(x)
> max(x)
> sin(x)
> cos(x)
> tan(x)
```


## Getting Help
- To get help or more information on any specific **named** function or dataset 
within a package, you can use the `help(myFunction)` or `?myFunction`
- Special character functions must be enclosed in quotes, for example `help("[[")`
- The `??` operator searches help for functions from packages not installed or 
loaded
- You can call examples using `example(myFunction)`

```r
> ?rnorm               

> ??dlnm

> example(rnorm)
```

## Example Help Page

![width](rnorm.png)

## Getting Help
- When you get error messages `Google` is **your best friend!**

```r
> rnorm(2 x 3)
Error: unexpected symbol in "rnorm(2 x"
```
<br>
![width](google.png)


## Warnings Are Not Errors!
- `Warnings` are the way R tells you that there might be issues with your input
or specifications
- The computation could be flawed

```r
> sqrt(-2)
[1] NaN
Warning message:
In sqrt(-2) : NaNs produced
```

# 2. Object Types

## Object Types 
- Everything in R is an **object**
- The most commonly used object types in R are:
     - Vectors
     - Matrices
     - Lists
     - Data Frames 

## Vectors
- The simplest object type is the `vector`
- They are the building blocks of other object types
     - Most of their features apply to the other object types
- A vector is a sequence of elements **of the same type**
- The most common basic vector types are: logical, numeric, integer, character
(string), and factor (categorical)
- Vectors can have any length (restricted by your computer's memory)


## Example Vectors

```r
> (myVector <- 1:10)
[1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10       # Numeric

> (myVector <- letters[1:5])
[1] "a" "b" "c" "d" "e"                 # Character 

> (myVector <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))
[1]  TRUE FALSE TRUE                    # Logical
```


## Numeric Vectors
- Numeric are the most common vector type
- Objects may be concatenated into a vector using `c()` 
- Numeric vectors may also be generated using `":"` 

```r
> (myNumbers <- 1:5)
[1] 1 2 3 4 5

> (fieldData <- c(1, 3, 5, 12, 1, 4, 9))
[1]  1  3  5 12  1  4  9
```

## Character Vectors
- Character vectors can be very useful for data analysis
- Often, they are used as plot labels and column names
- They **MUST** be entered using matching double (`""`) or single (`''`) quotes 

```r
> (x <- c("a", "b", "c"))
[1] "a" "b" "c"

> x <- c(z, w, k)
Error: object 'z' not found

> (gender <- c("male", "female", "female", "male"))
[1] "male"   "female" "female" "male"
```

## Character Vectors
- Character objects can also be concatenated using `paste()`

```r
>  c("R", "is", 'cool')            # Output with 3 elements
[1] "R"    "is"   "cool"

> paste("R", "is", "cool")         # Output with 1 element
[1] "R is cool"

> paste0("R", "is", "cool")
[1] "Riscool"

> paste("R", "is", "cool", sep="-")
[1] "R-is-cool"

> paste("R", "is", "cool", sep=".")
[1] "R.is.cool"
```

## Character Vectors
- Sometimes you may want to create character vectors concatenating **two vectors**
- This may be very useful when you need to add a **prefix** to your data

```r
> paste("Sample", 1:5)             # Notice the blank spaces 
[1] "Sample 1" "Sample 2" "Sample 3" "Sample 4" "Sample 5"

> paste("Sample", 1:5, sep="")     # Similar to paste0()
[1] "Sample1" "Sample2" "Sample3" "Sample4" "Sample5"

> paste0("Site", LETTERS[1:5]) 
[1] "SiteA" "SiteB" "SiteC" "SiteD" "SiteE"

```

## Character Vectors

```r
> paste("Today is", date())
[1] "Today is Tue Nov  8 08:07:48 2016"

> x <- 1:7; y <- letters[1:4]

> paste0(x, y) # Notice the recycling of elements in y
[1] "1a" "2b" "3c" "4d" "5a" "6b" "7c"
```

## Factors
- They are categorical variables (i.e. variables that can take one of a limited
number of values)

```r
(myData <- c(2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1))
[1] 2 2 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 1

(myData <- factor(myData))
[1] 2 2 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 1
Levels: 1 2

(myData <- factor(myData, labels=c("male", "female")))
[1] female female male female female male male female female male 
Levels: male female

plot(myData)
```

## Logical Vectors
- Logical vectors can take the values `TRUE`, `FALSE`, or `NA` ("not available")
- The first two may be abbreviated `T` and `F` (better to use `TRUE`/`FALSE`)
- Logical vectors can be generated by conditions using the following functions:
       - `<` and `>` 
       - `<=` and `>=`
       - `==` (exact equality)
       - `!=` (inequality)
       - `&` (and) 
       - `|` (or)
       

## Logical Operators

```r
> 1:5 < 3
[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE

> x <- 1:10

> x > 8               # Values of "x" greater than 8
[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE
 
> x <= 5               # Values of "x" lower than or equal to 5
[1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE

> x > 8 | x < 5       # Values of "x" greater than 8 OR lower than 5
[1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE

> x > 5 & x < 8       # Values of "x" greater than 5 AND lower than 8
[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE
```

## Logical Operators

```r
> x <- 1:11 ; y <- 11:1

> x == y              # Evaluate exact equality
[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
 
> x != y               # Inequality
[1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE

```

## Vector Operations
- Arithmetic operations are performed **element by element**
- Vectors **do not have** to be of the same length for arithmetic operations
- If they aren't, the shortest vector is **recycled** as required until they 
match the length of the longest vector

```r
> x <- 10:1

> y <- 1:3

> (v <- x + y)
Warning message:
In x + y : longer object length is not a multiple of shorter
object length
 [1] 11 11 11  8  8  8  5  5  5  2
```

## Logical Vector Arithmetics
- Logical vectors may be used in arithmetic operations
- If so, they are coerced into numeric vectors:
       - `FALSE` takes the value **0** and `TRUE` the value **1**

```r
> x <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)

> sum(x)
[1] 3
```


## Mixing objects of different types
- R objects may get mixed either by accident or intentionally
- It is recalled that this **is not allowed in R**
- R uses **implicit coercion** to represent of objects in a sensible manner

```r
> c(2, "A", "B")         # Character
[1] "2" "A" "B"

> c(TRUE, FALSE, 3)      # Numeric
[1] 1 0 3

> c('A', "B", FALSE)     # Character
[1] "A" "B" "FALSE"
```

## Explicit coercion
* You can **explicitly coerce** objects from one class to another using 
`as.foo()` functions

```r
> x <- 0:5

> class(x)
[1] "integer"

> as.numeric(x)
[1] 0 1 2 3 4 5

> as.logical(x)
[1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE

> as.character(x)
[1] "0" "1" "2" "3" "4" "5"
```

## Explicit coercion
* If R cannot coerce an object, it will produce `NA` 

```r
> x <- c("a", "b", "c")

> as.numeric(x)
[1] NA NA NA
Warning message:
NAs introduced by coercion 

> as.logical(x)
[1] NA NA NA

```

## Regular Sequences
- There are several options for generating vectors using of sequential numbers

```r
> 1:10              # Ascending
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
 
> 10:1              # Descending
 [1] 10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1

> n <- 10
> 1:n-1             # R reads (1:n)-1
 [1] 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

> 1:(n-1)
[1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```

## Regular Sequences...
- The `seq()` function is also commonly used to generate regular sequences (see `?seq`)
- It has several arguments but you may only need to specify a couple 
       - The first two arguments specify the beginning and end of the sequence
       - If only these two arguments are specified, **_the result is equivalent 
       to using the colon operator_**

```r
> 1:5
[1] 1 2 3 4 5

> seq(1, 5)
[1] 1 2 3 4 5
```

## Regular Sequences...
- The arguments of `seq()` (and any other R function) can be given in a **named**
form
- When names are provided, the order in which they appear is **irrelevant** 

```r
> seq(2, 4)
[1] 2 3 4

> seq(from=2, to=4)
[1] 2 3 4

> seq(to=4, from=2)
[1] 2 3 4
```

## Other seq() arguments
- There are other two very useful arguments to `seq()` 
       * `by=value`, which specifies the step size
       * `length.out=value`, which defines the length of the sequence
- If none is provided, the default `by=1` is assumed

```r
> seq(from=2, to=5, by=0.5)        # From 2 to 5 with steps of 0.5
[1] 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0

> seq(from=2, to=5, length.out=5)  # From 2 to 5 with length 5
[1] 2.00 2.75 3.50 4.25 5.00

> seq(5)                    # Sequence of length 5, step size = 1
[1] 1 2 3 4 5
```

## Replicating Objects
- Sometimes you may want to replicate a particular value to create a vector
- The `rep()` function is can be used to replicate objects in several ways

```r
> rep(1:4, times=2)
[1] 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4

> rep(1:4, each=2)
[1] 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4

> rep(1:4, times=c(1, 2, 2, 1))
[1] 1 2 2 3 3 4

> rep(1:4, each=2, len=10)    # Notice only the 1's are recycled
 [1] 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 1 1
```
<br>
- Type `?rep` for more examples


## Missing values
- When elements of a vector are **_not available_** or are **_missing_**, 
a place within the vector is given for them by assigning them the special values 
`NA` or `NaN` (not a number, for undefined maths operations)
- Any operation performed on `NA` elements results in an `NA` because the result 
cannot be known, and hence is not available
- The `is.na()` function evaluates if an element of x is an `NA`
- `is.nan()` evaluates if an element of _x_ is an `NaN`
- When the `is.na()` or `is.nan()` functions are applied to a vector, they 
return a logical vector of the same length, containing `TRUE` for `NA` or `NaN`, 
and `FALSE` otherwise.

## Missing values

<br>
```r
> x <- c(1, 2, 3, NA)
> x
[1]   1   2   3  NA 

> is.na(x) # NA result in TRUE
[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE

```

## Missing values
- Depending on the function, the presence of an `NA` may, or may not be an 
issue

```r
> x <- c(1, 2, NA, 4, 5)

> sum(x)
[1] NA
```
<br>
- The same happens with functions like `mean`, `min`, `max`, `sd` and many 
others
- To understand why we get `NA` for the sum of the head values, type
`?sum` 


## Missing values
- The default option `na.rm = FALSE` results in an `NA` if there is a missing 
value in the vector (`rm` stands for "remove")
- To prevent this behaviour, set `na.rm = TRUE`

```r
> x <- c(1, 2, NA, 4, 5)

> sum(x, na.rm=TRUE)
[1] 12
```

# 3. Matrices


## Matrices
- Matrices are **multidimensional vectors** that have a dimension attribute
- Their dimension attribute is a non-negative integer vector of length 2 that 
indicates the number of rows and columns
- The number of elements in a matrix **should** be equal to the product of 
`nrow` * `ncol`

## Matrices
- All elements of a matrix **MUST** be of the same type (numeric, character)
- Matrices are typically created **column-wise**, and so they start from the 
upper left corner and run down the columns
- They can also be created **row-wise** setting the argument `byrow=TRUE`
- Matrices can be created with the `matrix()` function or by adding a dimension 
attribute to a vector


## Matrices

```r
> matrix(1:10, nrow=2, ncol=5)
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,]    1    3    5    7    9
[2,]    2    4    6    8   10

> matrix(1:10, nrow=2, ncol=5, byrow=TRUE)
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,]    1    2    3    4    5
[2,]    6    7    8    9   10

> matrix(1:10, nrow=2, ncol=6)
    [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6]
[1,]   1    3    5    7    9    1
[2,]   2    4    6    8   10    2
Warning message:
In matrix(1:10, nrow = 2, ncol = 6) :
  data length [10] is not a sub-multiple or multiple of the
  number of columns [6]
```


## Matrices

```r
> x <- 1:10
> dim(x) <- c(5, 2)

> x
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    6
[2,]    2    7
[3,]    3    8
[4,]    4    9
[5,]    5   10

```


## Matrix attributes
* All matrices have the following attributes:
       * dimension, nrow, ncol, length, class
* Additionally, they may have colnames and rownames

```r
> dim(m)
[1] 5 2

> nrow(m); ncol(m) 
[1] 5
[1] 2

> length(m); class(m)
[1] 10
[1] "matrix"
```


## Matrix attributes

```r
> colnames(m) <- c("alpha","beta")      # Assign column names

> rownames(m) <- c("Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May") # Assign row names

> m
    alpha beta
Jan     1    6
Feb     2    7
Mar     3    8
Apr     4    9
May     5   10

> colnames(m)                           # Retrieve column names
[1] "alpha" "beta" 

> rownames(m)                           # Retrieve row names
[1] "Jan" "Feb" "Mar" "Apr" "May"
```


## Vector and Matrix Arithmethics
- Expressions are scanned from left to right
- Vectors **cannot** be longer than the matrix. If shorter, they are recycled

```r
> m <- matrix(1:10, 5, 2) ; v <- 1:4

> m + v
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    2    8
[2,]    4   10
[3,]    6   12
[4,]    8   10
[5,]    6   12
Warning message:
In m + v : longer object length is not a multiple of shorter
object length
```


## Transposing a matrix
- In some cases, you may need/want to transpose a matrix
- This operation can be done with the `t()` function

```r
> m 
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    6
[2,]    2    7
[3,]    3    8
[4,]    4    9
[5,]    5   10

> t(m)
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,]    1    2    3    4    5
[2,]    6    7    8    9   10
```

# 4. Data Frames

## Data Frames
- Data frames are one of the most commonly used type of object because they are
used to store **tabular data**
- Elements are stored in columns
     - Each column **MUST have** the same number of rows
- Data frames can store objects of **different classes**
     - The constituents of each column, however, must be **of the same class**


## Creating Data Frames
- Data frames may be created with the `data.frame()` function, or can be coerced 
from other object types
- By default, character objects are **coerced to factors** 

```r
> (dfr <- data.frame(foo=1:2, bar=c(TRUE, FALSE), qux=letters[1:2]))
  foo   bar qux
1   1  TRUE   a
2   2 FALSE   b

> m <- matrix(1:4, nrow=2, ncol=2)
> as.data.frame(m)
  V1 V2
1  1  3
2  2  4
```

## Inspecting a data frame
- Data frames can be inspected using `str()` and `attributes()`

```r
> str(dfr)
'data.frame':	2 obs. of  3 variables:
 $ foo: int  1 2
 $ bar: logi  TRUE FALSE
 $ qux: Factor w/ 2 levels "a","b": 1 2

> attributes(dfr)
$names
[1] "foo" "bar" "qux"

$row.names
[1] 1 2

$class
[1] "data.frame"
```

## Accessing Data 
- The most common way is to use the `"$"` operator
- When using `"$"` you **must** indicate both the name of the data frame 
and the name of the variable of interest
     - This may be tedious or inconvenient when performing multiple operations 
     with multiple variables

```r
> dfr <- data.frame(foo=1:5, bar=3:7, qux=6:10)
> dfr$foo
[1] 1 2 3 4 5

> dfr$qux
[1]  6  7  8  9 10

> dfr$foo * dfr$ bar - dfr$qux
[1] -3  1  7 15 25
```

## Accessing Data 
- An alternative is to use the `with()` function when performing multiple 
operations

```r
> dfr$foo * dfr$bar - dfr$qux
[1] -3  1  7 15 25

> with(dfr, foo * bar - qux)  
[1] -3  1  7 15 25
```

## Column and Row Names
- All columns in a data frame have a name
- You may assign column names or accept the defaults
- Row names may also be assigned when required

```r
> dfr <- data.frame(1:5, 3:7, 6:10); colnames(dfr); rownames(dfr)
[1] "X1.5"  "X3.7"  "X6.10"
[1] "1" "2" "3" "4" "5"

> colnames(dfr) <- c("alpha", "beta", "gamma")
> rownames(dfr) <- c("rock", "paper", "scissors","lizzard", "spock")
> dfr
         alpha beta gamma
rock         1    3     6
paper        2    4     7
scissors     3    5     8
lizzard      4    6     9
spock        5    7    10
```

## Adding Elements
- You may add elements to a data frame using the `"$"` operator

```r
> dfr$delta <- 21:25
> dfr
         alpha beta gamma delta
rock         1    3     6    21
paper        2    4     7    22
scissors     3    5     8    23
lizzard      4    6     9    24
spock        5    7    10    25
```


# 5. Lists

## Lists
- They are ordered collection of objects that **may NOT** be of the same type
- The function `length()` gives the number of components of the list 

```r
> lst <- list(letters[1:5], 1:8, c(TRUE,FALSE))
> lst
[[1]]
[1] "a" "b" "c" "d" "e"

[[2]]
[1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

[[3]]
[1]  TRUE FALSE
```

## Concatenate Lists
- You may use `c()` to concatenate lists
- When concatenating lists, the output is also a list

```r
> lstA <- list(1:3) 
> lstB <- list(c(TRUE, FALSE), 4.4^3*43-1)
> lstC <- c(lstA, lstB)

> lstC         
[[1]]
[1] 1 2 3

[[2]]
[1]  TRUE FALSE

[[3]]
[1] 3661.912
```

## Appending to Lists
- You may append extra elements to a list using the `"[]"` operator

```r
> lst     <- list(1:4)
> lst[3]  <- list(1+0i)

> lst      
[[1]]
[1] 1 2 3 4

[[2]]
NULL

[[3]]
[1] 1+0i
```

## Named Elements of Lists
- In some cases you may want to give names to each element of a list

```r
> lst <- list(numeric=1:4, 
             character=letters[1:10],
             factor=as.factor(c("siteA", "SiteB", "SiteC")),
             matrix=matrix(rnorm(4), 2, 2), 
             list=list(1e3))
```


# Indexing and Subsetting

## Indexing 
- Indices are extremely useful tools for creating subsets of an object 
- Typically, they consists of numeric vectors within the `"[]"` operator
- Indices can be logical, positive, negative, or character strings

## Indexing Examples

```r
> x <- c(-1, 0, 2, NA, NaN, 6)

> x[2]                      # Retrieve the second element of x
[1] 0

> x[1:5]                    # Gives the first five elements of x
[1]  -1   0   2  NA NaN

> x[-(1:3)]                 # Negative indexing 
[1] NA NaN 6

> x[(!is.na(x)) & x > 0]    # Elements of x when x !is.na AND x > 0
[1] 2  6
```

## Indexing 
- Indices could be useful when you need/want to replace a value in your set

```r
> x[is.na(x)] <- -999         # Set missing values in x to -999
> x
[1] -1  0  2  -999  -999  6

> x[x == -999] <- 0           # Set -999 to zero
> x
[1] -1  0  2  0  0  6
```

## Character Indices
- Character indices could be used when you have **named** elements in an object

```r
> names(x) <- c("alpha", "beta", "gamma", "delta", "epsilon", "mu")

> x[c("alpha", "gamma")]  
alpha gamma 
  -1    2 
   
> index <- c("beta", "mu")
> x[index]
beta   mu 
   0    6
   
> x[names(x) != "delta"]      # Negative indices do not work with characters
alpha    beta   gamma   epsilon     mu 
     -1      0      2      0      6 
```

## Truncating Vectors
- Indices could be very useful for truncating a vector

```r
> set.seed(123)
> x <- rnorm(10) # Vector of length = 10

> x <- x[2 * 1:5] # Reduce to length=5 retaining only even indices 
> x
[1] -0.23017749  0.07050839  1.71506499 -1.26506123 -0.44566197

> length(x) <- 3 # Truncate vector to length=3
> x
[1] -0.23017749  0.07050839  1.71506499 
```

## Indexing for Matrices 
- Indices can also be used with matrices

```r
> m <- matrix(1:10, nrow=2, ncol=5)
> m
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,]    1    3    5    7    9
[2,]    2    4    6    8   10

> m[9]              # Extract 9th element
[1] 9

> m[1, 3]           # Get the element of m on row 1, column 3
[1] 5

> m[2,]             # Retrieve second row
[1]  2  4  6  8 10
```

## Indexing for Matrices
- Indices could also be used to assign or modify elements of a matrix

```r
> (m <- matrix(nrow=2, ncol=2))    # Empty matrix
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]   NA   NA
[2,]   NA   NA

> m[ ,1] <- c(27.2, 14.5)          # Filling column 1
> m
     [,1] [,2]
[1,] 27.2   NA
[2,] 14.5   NA

> m[1 ,2] <- c(19.8)               # Fill 1st element of column 2
> m
     [,1] [,2]
[1,] 27.2 19.8
[2,] 14.5   NA
```

## Indexing and Subsetting Data Frames
- Numeric and character indices could be used to produce subsets of particular
rows and columns

```r
> dfr <- data.frame(foo=1:5, "bar"=6:10, "qux"=11:15)

> dfr[ ,2]               # Subset all rows of column 2 (vector)
[1]  6  7  8  9 10

> dfr["foo"]             # Retrieve variable "foo" (data.frame)
  foo
1   1
2   2
3   3
4   4
5   5

```

## Indexing and Subsetting Data Frames

```r
> dfr[c(1,3), ]
 foo bar qux
1   1   6  11
3   3   8  13

> dfr[1:3, ]     # Not the same as above, why?
  foo bar qux
1   1   6  11
2   2   7  12
3   3   8  13

> dfr[1:3, "foo"]      
[1] 1 2 3
```

## Conditional Subsetting
- Subsets may also be produced by specifying conditions

```r
> x <- dfr[dfr$foo > 3, ]   # Assign columns when "foo" >  3 to "x"
> x
  foo bar qux
4   4   9  14
5   5  10  15

> dfr[dfr$foo > 3 & dfr$bar == 9, ]  # What is the command asking?
  foo bar qux
4   4   9  14

> dfr[dfr$foo >= 4 | dfr$qux > 12, c(1,3)]  
  foo qux
3   3  13
4   4  14
5   5  15
```

## Conditional Subsetting
- An alternative way is to ise the `subset()` function

```r
> dfr[dfr$foo > 4, ]
  foo bar qux
5   5  10  15

> subset(dfr, foo > 4) 
  foo bar qux
5   5  10  15

> subset(dfr, foo >= 4 & bar != 9, select=c("bar", "qux"))
  bar qux
5  10  15
```

## Indexing for Lists
- List subsets including one or multiple elements may be retrieved using
the `"[]"` or `"$"` operators
- Whilst `"[]"` can be used with indices, the `"$"` can **ONLY** be used 
with literal names


## Indexing for Lists

```r
> lst <- list(numeric=1:4, character=letters[1:10], 
              logical=c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))

> lst[1]                # Notice the output is also a list
$numeric
[1] 1 2 3 4

> lst[c(1, 3)]          # Notice we use the c() command
$numeric
[1] 1 2 3 4

$logical
[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE
```

## Indexing for Lists

```r
> lst["logical"]
$logical
[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE         # Notice the output is a list

> lst$logical
[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE         # Notice the output is a vector

> lst[3]
$logical
[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE

> lst$3
Error: unexpected numeric constant in "lst$3"
```

## Indexing for Lists
- The `"[[]]"` opeartor is used to extract elements from a **single element**
of a list
- They may also be used to extract **nested elements** (e.g. the third 
element of the first list member)

```r
> lst[[1]]               # Notice the result is a vector
[1] 1 2 3 4

> lst[[c(1, 3)]]         # Notice the difference with lst[c(1,3)]
[1] 3

> lst[[1]][[3]]          # Same as above
[1] 3

> lst[["numeric"]][[3]]  # Same as above
[1] 3
```

## Indexing for Lists
- Indices may be stored in another variable
- This may come handy when you perform multiple operations

```r
> (lstNames <- names(lst))
[1] "numeric"   "character" "logical"  

> for(name in lstNames){      # Do the following for each "lstNames"
+     print(lst[[name]])      # print the member's components
+ }

[1] 1 2 3 4
[1] "a" "b" "c" "d" "e" "f" "g" "h" "i" "j"
[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE
```
