# Part II. Reading and Manipulating Data

## Overview
1. The working directory
2. Installing and loading packages
3. Reading and writing tabular data
4. Dates and times

# 1. The Working Directory

## The working directory
- Typically you set up a working directory before analysing any data
- The working directory is where `R` wwill find all files for reading and
writing in your computer
- You can ask `R` to tell you the location of current working directory with 
`getwd()`
     - The location of the working directory may change between users and 
     between versions of the OS
     - It **will also be different for different OS**
- If you do not know the location of the working directory you may get errors
in your computations or may store data into directories different to those you
need/want


## Example

<br>
```r
> getwd()
[1] "/Users/Felipe"       

> read.table(mydata.csv)
Error in read.table(mydata.csv) : object 'mydata.csv' not found
```


## Setting up the working directory
- If you know where the desired file is stored, you can either copy the file into your
working directory or change the working directory to the location of the file
- The `setwd()` function allows you to set (modify) the working directory
- The `list.files()` function gives you the names of all files in the wd
- Use simple names and **avoid directory names that contain symbols such as**
`*`, `&`, `$`, `£`, and so on 
- The use of diacritical marks is also **not allowed**


## Setting up the working directory
- The name of the working directory **must be given in quotes**
- **Unix** systems require the path to the directory written using backward slashes
between levels
       - `"/home/user/directory"` (*absolute path*) or 
       - `"~/directory"`  (*relative path*)

- **Windows** allows you define the paths with double forward slashes or single 
backward slashes:
       - `"C:\\home\\user\\directory"` or
       - `"C:/home/user/directory"`

## Example

```r
> setwd("/Users/Felipe/Documents/GitLab/Rprog/part2/")

> dir()
[1] "assets"     "index.html" "index.md"   "index.Rmd"  "libraries" 
[6] "mydata.csv"

> read.csv("mydata.csv")           # Now I can read the set
        Date sulfate nitrate ID
1 2003-01-01      NA      NA  1
2 2003-01-02      NA      NA  1
3 2003-01-03      NA      NA  1
4 2003-01-04      NA      NA  1
```


## Creating subdirectories
- `dir.create("newFolder")` creates a new subdirectory in the working
directory

```r
> dir.create("test")
> list.files()
[1] "Desktop"
[2] "Documents"
[3] "Downloads"
[4] "Dropbox"
[5] "scratch"
[6] "test"  

```

# 2. Installing and Loading Packages


## R Packages
* A **package** is a collection of programmed functions for specific tasks
* There are two types of packages: 
       - those that come with the base installation of R 
       - those you must manually download and install
* The so called `base` version contains the most common packages
* The `installed.packages()` command lists all packages you have installed in 
your R library
* There are hundreds of user-contributed packages that are not part of
the base installation, most of which are available through the 
[CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html).


## Installing packages
- The `install.packages("mypackage")` allows you to install a package 
- The name of the package must be in quotes
- Depending on the GUI of choice you may or may not be asked to select a 
repository
       - If asked, it is convenient to choose the mirror **geographically 
closest to you** 
- The web address of the repository can be included in the call
- Multiple packages can be installed at a time

```r
install.packages("apt", repos="http://cran.rstudio.com/")
```

## Example

## Installing multiple packages at once
- You may save some time and space 

```r
# Define *new* packages
> pkglist <- c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "xtable")

# Install packages
> install.packages(pkglist, repos="http://cran.rstudio.com/")
```

## Getting around the Active Desktop

- Installing packages within the AD could be a real pain
- Using `.libPaths("path/to/desired/folder")` will store packages in your
desired folder and prevent issues with the AD
- The IT Help Desk may have a more suitable long-term solution

```r
# An example
.libPaths(getwd())
```

## Loading packages and datasets
* The `require()` and `library()` functions load any package
* Some packages come with built-in datasets
* Load datasets with the `data()` command
* To unload a package use `detach("package:mypackage", unload=TRUE)`

```r
> require(maptools)
Loading required package: maptools
Checking rgeos availability: TRUE
Attaching package: ‘maptools’
The following object is masked from ‘package:sp’:
    nowrapSpatialLines

> data(wrld_simpl)
> detach("package:maptools", unload=TRUE)

```

# 3. Reading and Writing Tabular Data


## Reading and Writing data
- Some of the most frequently used functions for reading data into R are 
`read.table()` and `read.csv()`
- The analogous functions for writing data to files are `write.table()` and 
`write.csv`
- These functions read data in to RAM, so there are issues with big sets


## Reading data 
- These are some (not all) important arguments for `read.table()` and
`read.csv()`:
       - `file`, the name of the file
       - `header`, logical value indicating if the file has variable names as its
       first line
       - `sep`, a character indicating how the columns are separated
       - `colClasses`, a character vector indicating the class of each column in 
       the set 
       - `skip`, the number of lines to skip before beginning to read data

## Reading data 
- `read.csv` is analogous to `read.table(file, sep=",")` but exclusively for .csv
- Occasionally, values in the raw data have quotes which may cause numbers being 
read as characters
- To disable quoting, include `quote=""` as an argument on `read.csv()` or 
`read.table()`


## Reading small sets
- For small to moderately sized datasets, you can usually call `read.table()` 
or `read.csv()` without specifying any other arguments
- R will automatically:

       - skip lines beginning with `"#"`
       - figure out the number of rows (and how much memory needs to be 
       allocated)
       - figure out the type of variable in each column
- Telling R all these things directly makes the code faster and more efficient

## Let's download some data!

```r
# Load the dummy dataset 
> url1  <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FelipeJColon/'
> url2  <- 'Intro_R_Programming/master/mydata.csv'

> myUrl <- paste0(url1, url2)

> mydata <- read.csv(myUrl)
```


## Reading large sets 
- Specifying the `colClasses` option can make the code run **MUCH faster**, often 
twice as fast 
- To use this option, you need to know the class of each column
- If all columns have the same class, happy times!
- If not, there is a quick way to figure out the class of each column in the set


## Reading large sets 

```r
# Load the Dummy data 2 
> url2  <- "Intro_R_Programming/master/traffic.csv"
> myUrl <- paste0(url1, url2)

> system.time(
> myData <- read.csv(myUrl)
> )
   user  system elapsed 
  5.380   0.000   5.294 
  
> sample   <- read.csv(myUrl, nrows=100)
> classes  <- sapply(sample, class)

> system.time(myData2  <- read.csv(myUrl, colClasses=classes))                           
   user  system elapsed  
  3.482   0.000   3.437 
```


## Writing data
* The `write.table()` and `write.csv()` functions take these important arguments:
       - `x`, the object being written; preferably matrices or data frames
       - `file`, the name of the file 
       - `sep`, a character indicating how the columns are separated (for 
       `write.csv` the default is a comma)
       - `row.names`, logical value indicating whether row names are to be 
       written (I normally set it to `FALSE`)

## Writing data
- Try the following on your console and explore the differences in the output

```r
> dfr <- data.frame(foo=1:4, bar=letters[1:4])

> write.csv(x=dfr, file="mydata1.csv")

> write.csv(x=dfr, file="mydata2.csv", row.names=FALSE)
```

## Reading data from other sources
- R may is able to read and write many different types of data including, but 
not restricted to:
       - `.xls` and `.xlsx`
       - `.sav`, `.mtp` , `.spt`, `.dta`
       - `.nc`
       - `.jpg`, `.tiff`, `.png`
       - `.shp` 
       - `.rds` 
       - `JSON`, `html`, `SQL`
       - and many more
- **We will not cover these data types in this course**

# 4. Dates and Times


## Dates in R
- Dates have the class `Date`
- Dates are considered by R as the number of **days** since 1 Jan 1970
- Typically, dates are written using numbers as follows "YYYY-MM-DD" (e.g.
1970-01-01)


## Dates
- Dates may be coerced from character strings using `as.Date()` 

```r
> mydate <- as.Date("1970-01-01")

> mydate
[1] "1970-01-01"

> class(mydate)
[1] "Date"
```


## Dates
- There some generic functions for dates
       - `weekdays`: give the day of the week
       - `months`: give the month as string
       - `quarters`: give the quarter number ("Q1", "Q2", and so on)

## Dates

```r
> weekdays(mydate)
[1] "Thursday"

> months(mydate)
[1] "January"

> quarters(mydate)
[1] "Q1"

> format(mydate, "%Y")        # No generic function for Year
[1] "1970"
```

## Coerce strings to dates and times
- Often, dates and times are written in different formats when you retrieve data
- There are several functions that allow you to coerce dates in non-R format
to an R-date object

```r
> as.Date("02/27/92", "%m/%d/%y")
[1] "1992-02-27"

> as.Date("1jan1960", "%d%b%Y")
[1] "1960-01-01"

> strptime("02/27/92", "%m/%d/%y") # Check ?strptime for details
[1] "1992-02-27 GMT"

> strptime("December 31, 2015 23:40:59", "%B %d, %Y %H:%M:%S")
[1] "2015-12-31 23:40:59 GMT"

```


## Operations on dates and times
- You can perform some mathematical operations (only `+` and `-`), and evaluate 
logical conditions on dates and times (e.g. `==` and `<=`)

```r
> start <- strptime("2016-03-06 10:00:00", "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
> end   <- strptime("2016-04-07 17:00:09", "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S") 

> end - start
Time difference of 32.2501 days

> end > start
[1] TRUE

> start + 1 # adds 1 sec
[1] "2016-03-06 10:00:01 GMT"
```
- **How would you add one day to the start date?**


## Operations on dates and times
- `R` keeps track of leap years, leap seconds, daylight savings, and time 
zones!

```r
> start <- as.Date("2016-02-01"); end <- as.Date("2016-03-01") 

> end - start
Time difference of 29 days

> (ny <- strptime("2016-03-06 10:00:00", "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", 
                  tz="America/New_York"))
[1] "2016-03-06 10:00:00 EST"

> (nrw <-  strptime("2016-03-06 10:00:00", "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"))
[1] "2016-03-06 10:00:00 GMT"

> ny-nrw
Time difference of 5 hours
```
